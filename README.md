I found this article particularly intriguing given the current climate where the lines between freedom of speech and the spread of misleading or harmful information have become increasingly blurred, thanks to the ubiquitous presence of social media. This is especially true for health-related topics, like COVID. It is crucial hat the public receives accurate information to safeguard themselves and the wider community.
Today's social media algorithms can easily trap users in a "filter bubble," where they are constantly exposed to views and beliefs similar to their own. (Even those who consider themselves well-informed and educated are not immune to this phenomenon.)
The article highlights the pressure on major tech companies by governments to eliminate posts containing false information. I recall, during the lockdown, coming across numerous posts offering advice like "how to boost your immunity" or "follow these steps to avoid contracting COVID." Yet, most  of these suggestions lacked any scientific basis. The danger can arise when the public unquestioningly adheres to such misinformation.
It brings up a crucial question: where do we draw the line between upholding freedom of speech and curbing the intentional spread of falsehoods?
